Repository review

High-level positives

Clear separation: backend, frontend, shared (good for mono-repo evolution).
Shared game/card logic extracted (prevents duplication).
Docker support for dev/prod plus nginx reverse proxy (deploy-friendly).
Jest + ESLint + Tailwind + i18next already in place.
Domain-ish grouping in backend (game, room, auth, services, controllers).
Use of Redis + Mongo + Prisma suggests intentional layering.
Notable issues / inconsistencies

Incomplete / empty GameError.ts (dead file).
Mixed concern folders: services, controller, game, redis, room — boundaries not explicit.
Tests scattered (game/CarteadoGameRules.test.ts, backend tests/ folder, frontend src/tests/) → fragmentation.
Duplicate Jest configs per package without a root shared base.
Potential secret (key.json) committed at root.
Hooks live in \_ instead of conventional .husky.
Naming inconsistency: plural vs singular (cards/ vs room/, game/ vs games behavior).
Redis folder mirrors domain (redis/chat, redis/game, etc.) — could become leaky infrastructure coupling.
Mixed file naming styles (some kebab-case, some camelCase, some PascalCase for non-components).
Docker: separate dev/prod Dockerfiles but could DRY via multistage base.
Config scattered; no unified runtime config module with schema validation.
Prisma + Mongo coexist (Mongo for runtime + Prisma for relational?)—architectural rationale not documented.
Absence of CI pipelines / quality gates (no workflows folder shown).
No workspace root tooling for monorepo (e.g. pnpm/yarn workspaces file).
Frontend + backend share types manually—risk of drift if not versioned/built as a package.
shared not clearly published (is it TypeScript project reference? not sure).
Error handling pattern unclear (only one placeholder file).
Lack of boundary for application vs domain vs infrastructure (everything blended).
Socket logic path not clear (socket/... placeholder).
Recommended target structure (conceptual) / package.json (workspaces) pnpm-workspace.yaml (or yarn workspaces) /backend src/ domain/ (pure game + room rules, entities, value objects) application/ (use-cases / services orchestrating domain) infrastructure/ http (controllers, routes, middlewares) persistence (prisma, mongo, redis adapters) sockets config/ errors/ tests/ /frontend src/ app/ components/ lib/ (data fetchers, adapters) domain-shim/ (light wrappers around shared domain if needed) tests/ /shared src/ domain/ (cards, game rules if isomorphic) types/ utils/ /tools (scripts, generators) /deploy (compose, k8s manifests, nginx) .husky/ .github/workflows/

Key improvements (prioritized)

Quick wins (week 1)

Remove or implement GameError.ts; create a base DomainError + typed error map.
Centralize environment config: add backend/src/config/index.ts with Zod schema (env validation).
Move secrets: delete key.json from repo; load via env or sealed secret.
Unify test placement (choose colocated tests or central /tests, not both).
Add root shared Jest + ESLint config and extend in packages.
Add .husky directory and move git hooks; use simple-git-hooks or husky standard.
Document stack decisions in README.md (databases rationale, shared module usage).
Medium (weeks 2–4)

Introduce monorepo tooling: pnpm or Turborepo; convert shared into a buildable package consumed by backend/frontend (publish locally via workspaces).
Establish layering: domain (no imports from infra), application (coordinates), infrastructure (framework code).
Abstract Redis access: provide repository or cache service interfaces; avoid domain importing redis path directly.
Create unified error handling middleware (Express) mapping domain/app errors to HTTP status codes.
DRY Dockerfiles: multistage with shared base (node deps install once).
Add CI pipeline (lint, type-check, test, build) and optional preview deploy.
Add code ownership / module boundaries (e.g. using eslint-plugin-boundaries).
Longer term

Consider generating shared API/types (tRPC / OpenAPI) to eliminate manual request/response type drift.
Evaluate whether both Mongo + Prisma (SQL) are necessary; consolidate if possible to reduce cognitive load.
Add performance + load testing (k6 / Artillery) for real-time game flows.
Implement snapshot or property-based tests for game rule correctness.
Introduce feature flags system if game variants will grow.
Add metrics & observability layer (structured logging, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus endpoints).
Container security: add Trivy scan in CI.
Testing improvements

Add a fast unit test layer for pure domain functions (no framework).
Separate integration tests (Redis, DB, sockets) into a distinct jest project or tag.
Use test data builders/factories to reduce duplication.
Consider contract tests for shared types consumed by frontend.
Type sharing improvements

Use project references (tsconfig) and enforce imports from shared via path alias @shared/\*.
Export domain events / value objects to keep game logic truly isomorphic.
Consistency & naming

Adopt consistent file naming: either kebab-case for files or PascalCase for classes only.
Standardize folder naming: all plural or all singular (recommend plural for collections).
Rename game/ rules file names to align (e.g. TrucoGameRules.ts vs CarteadoGameRules.ts → consistent suffix).
Config & runtime

Add scripts/ wait-for or use docker healthchecks for dependent services.
Provide env.example per package.
Add runtime version pinning: .nvmrc or .tool-versions.
Frontend suggestions

Move cross-cutting helpers to src/lib/.
Co-locate component-specific styles/tests with component.
Ensure server/client component boundaries explicit (Next 13+).
Developer experience

Add make or Powershell task scripts for: install, dev, test, build, lint.
Enable incremental build caching (Turborepo / pnpm + TS project refs).
Pre-commit: lint-staged already present—extend to run type-check on staged TS (quick) with tsc --noEmit.
Security / quality

Add dependency scanning (GitHub Dependabot).
Enforce commit message style (Conventional Commits) for changelog generation.
Add rate limiting & input validation middleware (zod / express-validator) beyond auth.
Suggested immediate concrete actions (order)

Remove key.json, rotate secret, add to .gitignore.
Implement GameError.ts with a base error and an error catalog.
Create backend/src/config/env.ts with Zod validation and replace ad-hoc process.env usage.
Introduce root tsconfig.base.json (already present) → ensure each package extends and enable path aliases for @shared.
Add pnpm-workspace.yaml (or yarn) and convert shared to a published workspace package.
Consolidate Jest configs via shared preset (jest.preset.cjs).
Move tests into consistent locations and remove duplicates.
